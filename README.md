A web app demoing ResNet50, built using Flutter.

ResNet50 is a deep learning model trained on the ImageNet dataset. This model is imported from TensorFlow / Keras. 

The model is served over a Flask web server and then powered by a stateless Docker container on Google Cloud Run.

Feedback is greatly appreciated!

A huge thanks to [Felix Blaschke](https://github.com/felixblaschke) for the Particle background and [Rodolfo Hernandez](https://github.com/rjcalifornia) for the image upload concept via Flutter.
